### About me

I'm a computer science graduate with a major in cyber security. I spend my time helping real estate agencies build their online presence, improving my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/different-name/nix-files) and writing posts for my blog [different-name.dev](https://different-name.dev/).

As a hobby I 3D model, play online games, and experiment with *(break)* Linux.
