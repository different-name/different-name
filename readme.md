### About me

I'm a computer science graduate with a specialisation in cyber security. I spend my time helping real estate agencies build their online presence, improving my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/different-name/nix-files) and writing posts for my blog [different-name.dev](https://different-name.dev/).

For my hobbies, I 3D model, play online games, and experiment with *(and often break)* Linux.
